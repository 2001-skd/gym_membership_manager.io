# 💪 Gym Membership Manager

I go to a gym where they still use a notebook to keep track of memberships. I thought, what if they had a membership manager app? They could add members, filter and search records easily.

So, I created this as a mini project for practice and fun.

### 🔍 Features
- Add new gym members
- Search members by name
- Filter members by package
- Data stored in `localStorage`

### 📚 What I Learned
- DOM manipulation
- Implementing search and filter functionality
- Using `localStorage` for data persistence
