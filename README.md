Gym Membership Manager

I go to a gym where they still use a notebook to keep track of memberships. I thought, what if they had a membership manager app? They could add members, filter and search records easily. So, I created this as a mini project for practice and fun. Through this project, I learned how to build search and filter functionality, and how to use localStorage.
